# Introduction
Beets is a command line audio tagger with multiple plugins and options,
see ```https://beets.io/``` for full reference

The purpose of this configuration file is to allow the tagger to make as many choices as possible without requiring user input. Those choices are aggressive and may be incompatible with a less mainstream music collection or personally curated tags, so a recommendation would be to use it if you really don't want to be bothered by manually tagging (which is my use case :) ).

# Instructions
* Copy the packe contents to the following folder
 ```~/.config/beets/```

* Run with 
```beet import -q <target folder>```


That should be it.
